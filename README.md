MTR train tracking map, inspired by datarail from Instagram.

A simulation, not a real-time map. Things simulated:
- Travel times and dwell times
- Train frequencies

steps: 
1. Make a functional simulation of simple lines where trains simply go back and forth along a line. (Island Line, South Island Line, Tsuen Wan Line, West Rail Line, Disneyland Resort Line)
2. Make branches and special schedules possible (e.g. branching on TKO line, some trains ending at Ho Man Tin on the KT Line)
3. Make it possible for routes to have checkpoints (i.e. allowing for the line routes to be more precise). Will help for segments such as Tsing Yi -> Airport.
