MTR train tracking map, inspired by datarail from Instagram.

A simulation, not a real-time map. Things that are realistic:
- Travel times and dwell times
- Train frequencies

Steps: 
1. Make a functional simulation of simple lines where trains simply go back and forth along a line. (Island Line, South Island Line, Tsuen Wan Line, West Rail Line, Disneyland Resort Line, Airport Express?)
2. Make branches and special schedules possible.
- The TKO Line and East Rail Line have branches which require additional programming.
- For the Kwun Tong Line and Tung Chung Line, some trains terminate at stops that aren't the terminus during peak hours.
3. Make it possible for routes to have checkpoints (i.e. allowing for the line routes to be more precise). Will help for segments such as Tsing Yi -> Airport.
4. Add additional functions related to realism, such as:
- Keeping trains a certain distance apart (tricky on branch lines where branches take different amounts of time)
- Making sure trains crossing the Tsing Ma Bridge are a certain distance apart (need to synchronize trains on the Tung Chung Line and Airport Express)
- Adding acceleration/deceleration (can watch online videos of MTR trains to get an idea of the time needed to accelerate/decelerate)
- Simulating trains during off-peak hours
5. Add other modes of transport, e.g. light rail, buses, trams, ferries
