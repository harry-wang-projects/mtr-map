Stuff to do:

Set up auto-travel time function based on distance (account for checkpoints!)
Write the autocheckpoint function to automatically determine progress for checkpoints
Make images work for the train labels
Add settings bar (e.g. hiding the lines, enabling/disabling certain lines in the video generator)
Dragging stations around
New progress function for longer lines
Display the label next to the line
Split the code into shorter readable segments
